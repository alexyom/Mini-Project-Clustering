# Clustering

Two datasets were merged for this clustering project. The first dataset included information about marketing newsletters and e-mail campaigns. The second dataset contains information of which offer customers responded to. Two different types of K-Means clustering were used to group points with similar traits, the Elbow Sum-of-Squares Method and the Silhouette Method.
